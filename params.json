Specifically, \r\nAuditr will focus on two kinds of security vulnerabilities related to space and \r\ntime usage of programs:\r\n\r\n1. **Availability problems**: which arise when a user-provided input controls the \r\n   asymptotic complexity or termination of a program component. Since attackers can \r\n   substantially degrade system performance through carefully selected inputs, \r\n   availability problems can be exploited by malicious parties to launch denial of service \r\n   attacks.\r\n\r\n2. **Confidentiality problems**: which arise when two different user inputs result in \r\n   substantially different resource usage behaviors depending on the value of some \r\n   confidential data stored in the system.  If the program exhibits substantially different \r\n   space or time usage characteristics depending on user input, attackers can exploit \r\n   this behavior to learn confidential information through side channel attacks.\r\n</br>\r\n![alt tag](Auditr_approach.png)\r\n</br>\r\nAuditr’s key goal in identifying availability and confidentiality problems is to minimize both false positives and false negatives. In addition, every identified potential security vulnerability should be accompanied by sufficient evidence to convince a human analyst of the exploitable nature of the vulnerability. In the case of availability problems, the evidence provided by Auditr should be in the form of an input that triggers excessive resource usage. For confidentiality problems, Auditr’s goal is to provide a pair of inputs that result in disproportionate resource usage and identify the information that an attacker can glean by observing the program’s execution on these inputs. Ultimately, Auditr’s job is to maximize the productivity of the human analyst.\r\n\r\n## Available Tools\r\nIn this section, we introduce tools developed to address Confidentiality and Availability vulnerabilities related to space and time (known as side-channel):\r\n\r\n### Discriminer\r\n</br>\r\n![alt tag](Auditr_Discriminer.png)\r\n</br>\r\nThis is a tool for program analysis of side-channel related to confidentiality vulnerabilities. The goal is to Discriminate program traces based on observable behaviors like time, memory, and network. This tool is a combination of dynamic analysis techniques and probabilistic machine learning approaches to analyze program confidentiality. In the first step, dynamic analysis techniques are applied to extract data set from a target application (data includes program internal features and observable behaviors like execution time). Next, probabilistic clustering techniques are applied to extract similarities between data records. Finally, a classification method is applied to learns a set of discrimination formulae which distinguish between traces based on observable behavior introduced in the data set. \r\n\r\n##### GitHub source code available [here](https://github.com/cuplv/Discriminer)\r\n##### Complete Introduction and Background: [README](Discriminer_README.pdf) \r\n</br>\r\n### CONCERT\r\nCONCERT (CONfidentiality CERTifier) is a modeling and verification framework for program confidentiality. More specifically, it is a verification tool to check transducer properties related to confidentiality properties. Programs specified as transducer models are inputs of CONCERT. Given the input model, the tool reduces the input transducer model to a set of SMT formulae using [Z3-SMT Solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) to check interesting properties. For example, we show that k-valued property of transducers is a way to quantified information leakage in given models. Therefore, we check k-valued property in given model using a set of Z3-SMT Solver to argue about existence/absence of confidentiality vulnerabilities. The tool checks 2-ambiguity, bounded k-valued, unbounded 1-valued, and unique-run properties. \r\n\r\n##### GitHub source code available [here](https://github.com/cuplv/CONCERT)\r\n##### Complete Introduction and Background: [README](CONCERT_README.pdf)\r\n</br>\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n</br>\r\n",
